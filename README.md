# DotRunClone
Game clone for practice purposes, I'm making it only seeing the demo.

⚠️ I added an implementation of google Admob ads, while it is possible that they stopped working because of a Google restrinction, don't really know why but they sent me this.

(Which says that my account has a temporal limitation on the ad service)

I was very careful not to do tests with real ids so I do not understand the reason and they won't tell me
